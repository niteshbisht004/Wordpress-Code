How to Find a Backdoor in a Hacked WordPress Site and Fix It
1. Scan for Potentially Malicious Code
   We recommend Securi & wordfence plugin

2. Search the Uploads Folder for PHP Files
   find uploads -name "*.php" -print

3. Delete the .htaccess File
   Some hackers may add redirect codes to your .htaccess file that will send your visitors to a different website.
   If for some reason it isn’t recreated, then you should go to Settings » Permalinks in your WordPress admin panel. Clicking the ‘Save Changes’ button will save a new .htaccess file.

######################################
Check the wp-config.php File
    if there is anything that looks out of place. It might be helpful to compare the file with the default 
    wp-config-sample.php. You should delete any code that you’re certain doesn’t belong.

Make WordPress Login More Secure
    you should do is add two-factor authentication. This will protect your website against stolen passwords 
    and brute force attacks.

######################################
Password Protect WordPress Admin Directory
    Your WordPress admin area is already protected by your WordPress password. However, adding password protection
    to your WordPress admin directory adds another layer of security to your website.

    First login to your WordPress hosting cPanel dashboard and then click on ‘Password Protect Directories’ 
    or ‘Directory Privacy’ icon.

    Next, you will need to select your wp-admin folder, which is normally located inside /public_html/ directory.
    On the next screen, you need to check the box next to ‘Password protect this directory’ option and provide a 
    name for the protected directory.
    After that, click on the save button to set the permissions.

######################################
Limit Login Access to IP Addresses
    Another great way to secure WordPress login is by limiting access to specific IP addresses. This tip is 
    particularly useful if you or just a few trusted users need access to the admin area.

    AuthUserFile /dev/null
    AuthGroupFile /dev/null
    AuthName "WordPress Admin Access Control"
    AuthType Basic
    <LIMIT GET>
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
    # whitelist Syed's IP address
    allow from xx.xx.xx.xxx
    # whitelist David's IP address
    allow from xx.xx.xx.xxx
    </LIMIT>

    If you use more than one IP address to access the internet, then make sure you add them as well.

#####################################
Add Basic HTTP Authentication (htpasswd protection)
    To set it up manually, you will first need to create a .htpasswd file.
    Then upload the file to a directory under your wp-admin folder, such as:
    /public_html/wp-admin/htpasswd/

    Then create a .htaccess file with the following code and upload it to your /wp-admin/ directory. 
    Make sure you update the directory path and username.

    AuthName "Admins Only"
    AuthUserFile /code/wp-admin/.htpasswd
    AuthType basic
    require user yourusername

    <Files admin-ajax.php>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Satisfy any
    </Files>
